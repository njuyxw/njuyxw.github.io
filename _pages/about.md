Currently, I am a second-year graduate student of [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/) in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) advised by Professor [Yu-Feng Li](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/liyf/) and a member of [LAMDA](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/) Group, led by professor [Zhi-Hua Zhou](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/).

I got my B.Sc. degree in [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/) in June 2023 from [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn). In the same year, I was admitted to pursue a Ph.D. degree in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/) without entrance examination.

## Research Interests

My research interests include Machine Learning and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Currently, I am focusing on the subfields:

- **AI4Math**: applying AI techniques to mathematical problem solving and research
- **Reasoning in LLMs**: improving the reasoning capability of large language models
- **Neural Symbolic Integration**: integrating the power of machine learning and logical reasoning to boost the reasoning and planning capabilities of the AI system

## News

- ðŸ¤– [Feb 2025] Our paper "Step Back to Leap Forward: Self-Backtracking for Boosting Reasoning of Language Models" is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04404)!  We have released our [code](https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/Self-Backtracking) and [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yangxw/countdown-backtracking)!


- ðŸŽ‰ [Jan 2025] CARTS is accepted by ICLR2025.
